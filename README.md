How to use the Plugin
----
- Download the jar from the CI or compile it yourself.
- Put jar in your plugins directory

How to goto the moon
----
- Build a rocket by placing a furnace on top of any colour wool and then place a piece of wool on top of that.
- Open the rocket GUI by right clicking the furnace, if you built it right then you will have the Rocket Control Panel open.
- Put 1 piece of coal in the fuel slot and the burn indicator should turn on.
- Click launch and then watch yourself fly to the moon


- Note: We suggest taking more materials to the moon so you can get a rocket back!


Lunar Rovers
----
Placing a Minecart on the moon causes it to be a hovering lunar rover, these are the best transport on the moon. Be careful as the moon is always night mobs will shoot at your rover!

Things which are different on the moon
----
- It's always night!
- Build flags by placing wool on 2 fence posts!
- Mobs wear helmets and are labelled Aliens!
- Jumping mechanics are different!
- Find lunar armour which reduces the gravitation effect!
- The surface is hilly with crators everywhere, sometimes there is loot in the crators.
- You collect Moonstone!
- Torches don't work as there is not enough oxygen!
- Lunar Armour can be found and worn to reduce gravity impact.
- Meteors everywhere!
- Lots of loot!
- Fire doesn't burn, so perfect for wooden houses!
- Ice pools as well as abandoned tents!
- You start to wonder why you ever came to the moon...


Things you should try
----
- Play survival in the moon and try get back to the overworld without a rocket!
- Dig into a meteor to find goodness!
- Do some moon rover racing with a friend!
- Get out a rocket before you go to the moon and try to survive!
- Crash a rocket.
- Get a full set of lunar armour!
